Iâ€™m looking to change my career towards a Junior Software Tester position. I have no commercial experience in this field, but I am an active contributor to the Mozilla project, performing the duties of a software tester. I believe some of the things I learned as a skilled professional, with more than 10 years of experience in the law enforcement and security sector, are translatable to the role ahead.

I have had the opportunity to be trained according to the highest standards when it comes to communication and social psychology. Working closely with people, I encountered numerous situations which required attention to details and a high level of emotional intelligence. I feel this is what makes me a detail-oriented tester and a good team player.

My previous experience provided the perfect environment to develop my ability to work in a team and to be able to adapt quickly in different situations. I also appreciate the value of continuous learning through multiple and various challenges.
